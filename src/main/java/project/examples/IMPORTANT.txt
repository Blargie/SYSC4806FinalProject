- IMPORTANT -
The "Examples" package of the project is OLD files from Ethan Houghting's LAB6 (Part 1, the static page implementation)
Files in this package:
- AddressBook.java
- AddressBookController.java
- AddressBookRepository.java
- BuddyInfo.java
- BuddyInfoRepository.java
Are all intended to be REMOVED by the end of Milestone 1, they are intended as reference files for the implementation of the backend logic
and RESTful API used in the project. They are NOT to be used in the final project, they are only here for reference purposes.
